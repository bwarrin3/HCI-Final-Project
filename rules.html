                <div class="rule" id="consistency">
                    <h2>Strive for Consistency</h2>
                    <p>This rule states the site the user is visiting must be consistent from page to page. This allows
                        the user to easily identify what a section is, what a button does, or how to navigate somewhere
                        else. This will make the user be able to navigate seperate pages faster and easier.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule" id="shortcuts">
                    <h2>Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>This rules states the site should be easily navigatable with a minimum number of clicks. More
                        frequent and advanced users should also be able to do common functions with a set of commands,
                        i.e. Ctrl + c. This allows users to quickly navigate a website and lets frequent users be able
                        to speed up productivity. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="rule" id="feedback">
                    <h2>Offer Informative Feedback</h2>
                    <p>This rule states if a user interacts with the website somehow, there should be feedback to them
                        based on their action. This allows users to know whether something is clickable and if they have
                        clicked it. This will make the user know if their interactions are doing something or not.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="rule" id="dialogue">
                    <h2>Design Dialogue to Yield Closure</h2>
                    <p>This rules states if a user takes an action on the website, there should be a dialogue to confirm
                        that action was taken. This allows users to know if they reached the end of a sequence of
                        actions. This will make the user not need to think about that part of the ineractions anymore,
                        letting them think about other things more freely.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="rule" id="errorHandling">
                    <h2>Offer Simple Error Handling</h2>
                    <p>This rules states if an error is to occur the user should be able to understand what went wrong
                        to try to rememdy it. This allows users to know if something they did is incomplete or wrong, or
                        if something went wrong with the application itself. This makes users less frustrated if
                        something were to go wrong.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="rule" id="permitReversal">
                    <h2>Permit Easy Reversal of Actions</h2>
                    <p>This rule states if a user took a wrong action, that action can easily be undone. This allows
                        users to rest easy knowing they don't have to interact perfectly with the website. This makes
                        users less frustrated if a mistake is made. </p>
                </div>


                <div class="rule" id="locusControl">
                    <h2>Support Internal Locus of Control</h2>
                    <p>This rule states a user should be given freedom and control in the website. This allows users to
                        feel in control and not as if the decisions have been made for them. This makes users happier as
                        they can customize the website to their preferences and needs.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="rule" id="memoryLoad">
                    <h2>Reduce Short Term Memory Load</h2>
                    <p>This rule states a user shouldn't be overloaded with information visiting a website. This allows
                        users to easily identify what the important information is and how to navigate to more detailed
                        sections if needed. This makes users come away from the webiste more knowledgable and less
                        overwhelmed.</p>
